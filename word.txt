Most of them I tried using, but didn't work out for me or gave errors like search module not found despite importing packages. Or I did work out with selenium web driver and it works great if used with Firefox or chrome or Phantom web browser, but still I felt it was a bit slow in terms of execution time, as it queried browser first and then returned search result.
